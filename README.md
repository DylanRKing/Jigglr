A simple tool for jiggling the mouse and keeping your screen awake.

Set the inactivity timer to the desired period and hit start, leave it running in the backround and you're all set.

The tool won't do anything if you're actively moving your mouse around, but whenever you stop and walk away it will kick in after the timer and jiggle your mouse around every ~5 seconds.
